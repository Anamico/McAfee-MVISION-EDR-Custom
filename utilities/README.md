# McAfee-MVISION-EDR-Custom Utilities

A collection of useful utilities for remote reactions and collectors

A powerful option for custom collectors and reactions is to have a payload you wish to execute and host it on an organisation share point.
This means you do not need to pre-install a utility in order to utilise it for investigations and remediation.

This is a place to share/find examples of utilities that can be compiled for various platforms.

You could very well bake them in to SOE images, or just put them in a global read location as a zip file, and pull down and execute them as required.
